Hi, My name is Jhon. I'm a full-stack developer with almost 2 years of experience, mostly working with dot net, JS, HTML, CSS and Sql. 
I am full of passion, I love software thatÂ´s why I am always trying learn more about the technologies that I use on my working day. 
I like to share my findings about good articles that can help the team.

I would like to be part of the project and bring my abilities to the team.
